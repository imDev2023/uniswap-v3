# uniswap-v2

A Uniswap-**V3**-based DEX + bonding-curve launchpad on **Robinhood Chain** (chainID 4663). New projects launch via a pump.fun-style bonding curve; on reaching a fixed-ETH threshold a token graduates atomically into a permanently-locked, full-range `TOKEN/WETH` V3 pool.

The architecture decisions driving the build are charted on the **wayfinder map** — GitHub issue [#1](https://github.com/imDev2023/uniswap-v2/issues/1) (label `wayfinder:map`); its closed child tickets record each locked decision.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in this repo's **GitHub Issues** via the `gh` CLI. External PRs are **not** a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default canonical label vocabulary — `needs-triage` / `needs-info` / `ready-for-agent` / `ready-for-human` / `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Multi-context layout: a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root points to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files (created lazily by `/domain-modeling`). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
