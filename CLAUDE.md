# uniswap-v3

A Uniswap-**V3**-based DEX + bonding-curve launchpad on **Robinhood Chain** (chainID 4663). New projects launch via a pump.fun-style bonding curve; on reaching a fixed-ETH threshold a token graduates atomically into a permanently-locked, full-range `TOKEN/WETH` V3 pool.

The architecture decisions driving the build are charted on the **wayfinder map** — GitHub issue [#1](https://github.com/imDev2023/uniswap-v3/issues/1) (label `wayfinder:map`); its closed child tickets record each locked decision.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in this repo's **GitHub Issues** via the `gh` CLI. External PRs are **not** a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default canonical label vocabulary — `needs-triage` / `needs-info` / `ready-for-agent` / `ready-for-human` / `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Multi-context layout: a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root points to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files (created lazily by `/domain-modeling`). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Build workflow (for the next session)

The contracts live in `contracts/` (Foundry). Toolchain is installed at `~/.foundry/bin` and OpenZeppelin + Uniswap V3 artifacts are in `contracts/node_modules` (both persist on disk).

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"
cd contracts && forge test          # fork tests hit Robinhood Chain (rpc alias: robinhood = 4663)
```

Ticket rhythm (build tickets #12–#21, tracked as GitHub issues; the map is #1, spec is #11):
1. One ticket per branch: `build/<NN>-<slug>`, branched from `main`.
2. Implement + write tests at the fork-test seam; keep the full suite green.
3. Run `/code-review` (two axes) against `main`; apply worthwhile findings.
4. Comment status on the ticket; merge the branch to `main` before the next ticket.

**Current state:** #12–#15 done and merged to `main` **except #15**, which sits on branch `build/04-anti-snipe` (one commit ahead of `main`). Next up is **#16 (atomic graduation + full-range seeding)** — the headline ticket, which ties the bonding curve to the #12 V3 deployment.

**Deferred for #16:** (a) prefactor the `BondingCurve` constructor's growing arg list into a `CurveConfig` struct (flagged in #15 review); (b) re-test the anti-snipe cap against the real create-then-first-buy path and on the full-lifecycle fork test.
